    "    'n_estimators': [10, 20],\n",
    "    'max_depth': [2, 5],\n",
    "    'min_samples_leaf': [0.1, 0.2],\n",
    "    'random_state': [0]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can generate a list like this:\n",
    "```CPP\n",
    "[[10, 20],\n",
    " [2, 5], \n",
    " [0.1, 0.2]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",

    "[(10, 2, 0.1),\n",
    " (10, 2, 0.2),\n",
    " (10, 5, 0.1),\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the values in both the list of tuples and list of dictionaries are in the same order as the original hyperparams dictionary.  For example, the first value in each is n_estimarors, then max_depth, and then min_samples_leaf:\n",
